            <p>Hi. I’m a communication design, graphic designer. <br/>From project to project, I want to be able to capture a brands primary message within my design and take a strict approach to a colors, compositions, and type working together. <br/>Using Adobe programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and others, I'm comfortable with creating highly polished designs for digital and print, and can do primary and secondary physical work, enabling a three dimensional look. <br/>To view my implementations of different approaches and designs for each project, please check out my portfolio.</p>

                    <h4>UI / UX Design</h4>
                    <p>I develop interfaces that blend functionality and aesthetics through user-centered UX/UI design. Based on UX research, I design intuitive user flows, visualize prototypes in Figma and Adobe XD, and iterate based on feedback. UI design utilizes responsive layout, typography, micro-interactions, and more to enhance informativeness and ease of use. A consistent UI style guide supports collaboration and aligns with project goals and user characteristics.</p>

                    <p>I focus on creating a cohesive and powerful expression of a brand's identity through branding and brand experience (BX) design. Through research, I develop a deep understanding of a brand's core message and the needs of its target audience. Then,I consider the critical touchpoints between a brand and its customers to design intuitive user flows that help users experience and understand the brand's value naturally.</p>

                    <p>My strength is creating intuitive and effective communication between users and brands through interaction design. I design with subtle interaction elements and user feedback to ensure that at each touchpoint, users understand the brand's message and connect with it naturally. We do this through iterations of prototyping and user testing, making adjustments to optimize the experience for real users.</p>
